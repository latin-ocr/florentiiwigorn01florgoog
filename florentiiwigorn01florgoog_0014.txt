Now it is to be obser-ved, that Wult'stan died
in the year 1005, that ic, twenty-three years
before the death os Florence himself, conse-
quently while the latter was busily employed
on the task of incorporating his chronicle os
English affairs with the pages of Marianus. It
must also be borne in mind that Orderic was
not only a learned and well-informed man for
⁶ his time, but that he was by hirth an English·
Ι inan, and one by no means indifferent to the
credit of his native country. Had it then been
the joint work of Marianus and Floreuce to
which, by desire of Wulfstan, John appended
his own learned labourS, is it at all probable
that Orderic the Englishman would have desig-
· nated it as the work of Marianus, omitting all
mention of the share taken in it by his follow-
countryman, Florenca of Worcesterl More
probable seems the conclusion, that during Wulf-
stan’s lifetime, and while Florence. was engaged
on his work, the labours of John were bestowed
on the original chronicle of Marianus, and that
the manuscript containing those labours is no
longer known to exist At all events, if any
part of any ol the extant copies is the work os
this John, it cannot be the continuation, and
hardly any portion subsequent to 1005, the year
of Wulfstan's death. In fine, can any part of
any copy os the chronicle of Marianus Scotus ’
embodying Florence os Worcester be pointed
out as answering the description given by
Orderic of the labours of the monk J ohnl
