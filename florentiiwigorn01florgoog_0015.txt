In support of the soregoing view of the case,
may be added, that, so far from exhibiting any
matter derived from Guy ol Amicus-a writer
remarkahly diffuse and circumstantial,-the
chronicles, whether of Marianus or Florence,
are particularly meagre and void of detail in
what they impert relative to William, duke or
count ol Normandy, and the battle os Senlae or
Hastings.

The Continuation to the year 1295 is from a
manuscript belonging to Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge. This Continuatiorr, from its com·
mencemeut to the year 1152, consists ol a mere
transcript from the chroniele os Henry of Hun-

tingdon and his continuator. This portion it
has been deemed unneeessary to reprint. What
follows is a manscript, by the same hand, of the

chronicle of John de Taxster‚ a monk of Bury
St. Edmund’s, as far as the year 1265 inclusive, ,
when the manuscripts ol that chronicler termi-
nate. The remainder is a compilation by a
monh os the same place-probably the scribe
himself,-‚as‚ among the events which he records,
those relating to Bury occupy a considerable
space.

Though De Taxstcr, like other monastic
chroniclers, began his work with the Creation,

it is only from the year 1152, where it is taken Ἴ

up by the monk of Bury, as a continuation to
Florence, that it commences 'to be of any in·
terest; otherwise the portion from the landing
of the Germanic tribes in Britain would have
been given, as an appendix to the present
edition.
