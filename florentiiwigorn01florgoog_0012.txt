fessor, his narrative is in several instances much
more circumstantial than anyto be found in the
existing manuscripts of that record, from which

Confessor. Whence it seems probable that he

events connected with worcester, both Florence
and his continuator are naturally inclined to be

(n. n. 1062), and of his death (1095), no traces of
which are to be found in any manuscript of the
Saxon chronicle.

monk of Worcester named John, though hardly
identical with another moult of the same name
