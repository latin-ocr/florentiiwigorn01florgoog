Aster due praise bestowed 011 the work of
William of Poitiers, Orderic adds: ‘Guy, hishop
of Amiens, also published a poem, in which,
imitating Maro and Papinius, in recording the
deeds of heroes, he has described the battle of
’ Senlao, reproaching and condemning Harold,
but praising and magnifying william? He
then goes on to say, that ‘a monk of Worcester
named John, venerable alikc for his morals and
learning, faithfully extracted from William of
Poitiers aud Guy of Amiens that which he
added to the chronicles of Marianus Scotus,
concerning William the Conqucror and his sons,
William Rufus and chry, and the events which
toolr place under them, until his (Orderic's) own
time3 and that the said John, following the
example oi Marianus, had recorded the transac-
tions os nearly a hundred yearS, which, at the
desire of Bishop Wulfstan, he had inserted into
the above-mentioned chronicles, in which he
communicated many things relating to the Ro·
mans, FrankS, GermanS, and other nations.’ ¹ Δ
