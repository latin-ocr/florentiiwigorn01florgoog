1. MS. corp. Chr. Coll. Oxon. In large folio,
of the twelfth century, written hythe same hand
till towards the end. Prefixed to it (besides the
lists of prelates and royal genealogies given in
the present edition) are lists of kings of France,
dukes of Normandy, the seventy disciples, etc.
It ends abruptly at the year 1140, where it has
suffered mutilation.¹ This manuscript, though
occasionally less comprehensive than those to he
hereafter mentioned, may, nevertheless, he re-
garded as the purest and hest extant. In the
margin are written, in another and, of course,
later hand, many notices relating to the succes-
sions and deaths of bishops and abbots, which,
when not evidently copied from Wittia'm of
Malmesbury (De Gestis Pontificum), will he
found in the form of root-notes to the present
edition. It is matter of regret, that, in the
insertion of these notices, more regard has not
been paid to dates. ..In a few instances the
same entry is repeated under different dates,
under one in the text and another in the margin.
These notices refer for the most part to the seeb
of Hereford, Chester, and Lichfield. This
manuscript, which forms the basis of the pre-

sent text, formerly belonged to the abbey of .

Worcester.
