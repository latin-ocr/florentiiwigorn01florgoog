Nuxr alter the Ecclesiastical History of
Beda, and the Saxon chronicle, the principal
source of early English History is the chronicle
grafted on that of Marianus Scotus by Florence,
a monk of Worcester.

The few particulare that have reached our
time os the Life of MarianuS, are derived from
the noticcs contained in the chronicle as com-
posed by Florence, viz. that he was a native
of Ireland, born in the year 10283 that in 1056
he forsook the land of his birth, and became a
monh in the Scottish cloister of St. Martin at
Gologne3 that in 1059 he was ordained priest at

Wiirzburg, and then lived as a recluse at Fulda, ·

which place he left in the year 1069 for Mentz,
where, in the monastery of St. Alban the Martyr,
he died about the year 1086.1

As the object here in view requires but a
slight notice of Marianus, it will suffice to add,
that the work compiled by him, into which
Florence inserted his chronicle of English affairs,
is a general chronicle from the creation of the
world to his own times. On the supposition
that the Dionysian era of the birth os Christ
is fixed too late hy twenty-two years, Marianus
added a double chronology to his work, one

¹ His chronicle is continued abbot ot' st. Disihod, in the dio·
to the year 1200, by Dodechin‚ cese of Treres.
